# Computational Physics BSc Topic
This code was written in 2013 specifically to produce data for my BSc-thesis on the behavior of polymers. It's untested, written by an absolute beginner (at the time) with no intention of maintaining it beyond this. It's written in scilab because that's what my university wanted to use. There was no thought put towards architecture, readability or testing.

My thesis didn't discuss the code, but it's output.
